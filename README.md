# CLI Panorama creator from RAW

This script helps me manage and easily create panoramas from sequences of NEF (RAW) images taken close in time and with equal shooting settings (shutter speed, ISO...).

## Dependencies

* darktable
* hugin (and other pano tools that usually come bundled with it)
* CLI image viewer like sxiv
* exiv2
